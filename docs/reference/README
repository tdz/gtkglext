This directory contains the reference documentation
for GtkGLExt. For more information about GtkGLExt
see:

 http://gtkglext.sourceforge.net/


REQUIREMENTS
============

To build the documentation, you must have the gtk-doc
package installed. To rebuild the template files,
you must have the current version of the GTK+
header files installed.


BUILD
=====

First, run configure to generate the makefiles for this
module. There is one option specific to this package

  --with-html-dir=DIR   top of installed HTML documentation tree


The Makefiles in the gdkglext/ and gtkglext/ subdirs each define
three targets:

 templates:
  
  Scan the headers and merge the results with the current 
  template files

 sgml:

  Generate SGML files using the DocBook DTD from
  the template files

 html:

  Generate HTML from the SGML files.

To build the documentation, do:

 make sgml
 make html

You should only run the 'make templates' step if you
need to regenerate the templates for a more recent
version of the GtkGLExt sources.

INSTALLATION
============

 make install
